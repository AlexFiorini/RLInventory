## How does it work?
Basically, it searches from all the json exported from Bakkesmod's plugin to determine which items are tradable from PC. No, your items tradable on other platforms won't show up. Neither credits.
You can choose basically every filter you want to use, and you can search between:
- Name
- Type of item
- Paint
- Certification
- Quality
- Special Edition (If it's an attribute. If it's in the name you have to search for it in Name).

## How do I use it?
- Open Bakkesmod and launch Rocket League
- Press F2
- Go to plugins
- Click on "Better Inventory Export"
- Click on "Dump to .json"
- Launch RLInventory
- Enjoy your tradable inventory!
If the software doesn't show your inventory, you can load it by clicking on "Choose file" and by going to your Bakkesmod directory, then to "data" and you'll find "inventory.json"
