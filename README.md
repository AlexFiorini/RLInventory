## How does it work?
Basically, it searches from all the json exported from Bakkesmod's plugin to determine which items are tradable from PC. No, your items tradable on other platforms won't show up. Neither credits.
You can choose basically every filter you want to use, and you can search between:
- Name
- Type of item
- Paint
- Certification
- Quality
- Special Edition (If it's an attribute. If it's in the name you have to search for it in Name).
